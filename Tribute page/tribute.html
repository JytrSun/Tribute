				About the Legend
			</h1>

			

<p>
				☛ Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the 
                 village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab 
                 in what was then British India and is today Pakistan.<br><br>
				☛ Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, 
                 taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, 
                 and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.<br><br>
				☛ After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in
                 the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, 
                 founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, 
                 which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.<br><br>
				☛ Singh was a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) 
                  and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to 
                  Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928
				<br><br> ☛ Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism 
                   but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai,
                   and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, 
                   and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and 
                   to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name.”</strong>
				<br><br> ☛  the Assembly Bomb Statement:
                   We hold human life sacred beyond words. We are neither perpetrators of dastardly outrages ... nor are we 'lunatics' as 
                   the Tribune of Lahore and some others would have it believed ... 
                   Force when aggressively applied is 'violence' and 
                   is, therefore, morally unjustifiable, but when it is used in the furtherance of a legitimate cause, 
                   it has its moral justification.
				<br><br> ☛ Bhagat Singh left home for Kanpur when his parents tried to get him married, 
                   saying that if he married in slave India, “my bride shall only be death” and 
                    joined Hindustan Socialist Republican Association.
				<br><br> ☛ His death sentence was pronounced on 7 October 1930, which he heard with defiant courage.
                    During his stay in jail, he went on a hunger strike against the policy of better 
                   treatment for prisoners of foreign origin
				<br><br> ☛ He was sentenced to be hanged on 24 March 1931, but 
                   it was brought forward by 11 hours to 23 March 1931 at 7:30 p.m.
                   It is said that no magistrate was willing to supervise the hanging. 
                   After the original death warrants expired it was an honorary judge who signed and oversaw the hanging.
				<br><br> ☛ Legend says, Bhagat Singh marched to the gallows with a smile on his face and 
                   his one last act of defiance was shouting
                  "Down with British imperialism."
				<br><br> ☛ He was attracted to anarchist and Marxist ideologies which further bring revolutionary ideas to his mind. 
                   He was a bright student and a reader, and always actively
                   participated in extra-curricular activities.
				<br><br> ☛ He was a brave freedom fighter. His feelings of patriotism were not only restricted against British rule 
                   but also towards the division of India on communal lines. 
                   He was a genius, mature, and always attracted to socialism. 
				<br><br> ☛ He wanted to grow guns in the fields using which he can fight with the British.
                   When he was 8 years old, instead of talking about toys or games
                   he always speaks about driving out British from India.
				<br><br> ☛ He quit school at thirteen to devote his life to Indian Independence. 
                  Popularly he is known as <b>Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh.</b> 
                  Bhagat Singh was a great actor and theatre artist in college. 
                  He appeared in a number of plays. 
                  <b>‘Rana Pratap,’ ‘Samrat Chandragupta,’ and ‘Bharata-durdasha’ </b> were among the plays in which he appeared.
			     <br><br> ☛ Bhagat Singh had told the British that “instead of hanging they should shoot him” 
                   but the British did not consider it. He mentioned this in his last letter.
                   Bhagat Singh wrote in this letter, “Since I was arrested during the war. 
                   Therefore, I cannot be punished for hanging. Let me be thrown into the mouth of a cannon. 
                   “This shows his braveness and his feeling for the nation.
				<br><br> ☛ Singh and Sukhdev plotted to assassinate Superintendent of Police James Scott in Lahore
                   in order to avenge Lala  Lajpat Rai’s death. However, John Saunders, the Assistant Superintendent of Police,
                    was shot in a Case of mistaken identity
                   He and Batukeshwar Dutt threw bombs into the Central Assembly Hall in Delhi 
                   a year later, shouting “Inquilab Zindabad!”
				<br><br> ☛He was found guilty of killing a British police officer and hanged on March 23, 1931. 
                   It is said that Bhagat Singh was smiling when he was hanged. In fact, this was done with
                   a fearlessness to “lowered British imperialism”.
